### Self comparison the Merge sort and Insert sort algorithms

**Time**: The _Insert_ needs less operation and memory allocations, and potentially it is faster than the _Merge_

**Memory**: The implemented Insert algorithm consumes less memory than the implemented Merge algorithm. The Insert
algorithm operates the input array elements but the Merge one creates new arrays and only after makes the comparison.

**Input**: Running the _Insert_ against the sorted array requires fewer operations comparing to the _Merge_ algorithm,
at the same time the _Merge_ algorithm still needs to do the same amount of operations.
